# InSilicoQ

**InSilicoQ** is a Quantum Computation based package for various steps in Drug Design and Discovery. Drug design is a highly complicated process and It involves lots of steps. By InSilicoQ, we aim to utlize Quantum Computing for faster Virtual Screening and De Neuvo drug design. 


## A few words about Quantum Computing

Quantum comuting is emergeing as a powerful computational model. The main algorithms implemented in the package is conssited of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA)
and Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms.

* VQA
* Quantum Principal Component Analysis(QPCA)
* Quantum-kmean
* Quantum Neural Networks
* Quantum Kernel Methods



## Instalation

The project uses __Qiskit__ for performing Quantum Computation routines which is a __IBM SDK__. The __Colab Notebook__ provides a guide how to use the packges integrated.










**Project Status:** In progress (I'll add Quantum Kernel methods soon)
